h2. what is this?

This is a simple way for CC folks to install RITES severs 
(app_server, sakai_server, database_server) on minimally configued centos boxes.

Its composed of a bunch of shell scripts which 'source' each other. A poor mans dependancy management.


h2. where do I start?

It would probably be helpful to have ssh configured on the remote host to use key authentication.

you can bootstrap the process by configuring a new riteshost with the script 'riteshost.sh' which takes
one argument, the host to inject the system into, eg: @./riteshost.sh someremote.machine.org@

After that you will need to log in the remote system, and 'cd' into ~/rites_host and issue one of:

@./mysql-server.sh@

@./app-server.sh@

@./rieps.sh@

h2. example session: configuring the mysql-server:

In this session we configure a remote host to act as the mysql server.
the basic steps are 


@./riteshost.sh someremote.machine.org@

@ssh someremote.machine.org@

@cd ~/rites_host/@

@./mysql-server.sh@ 

And that's really all there is to it....

h2. Todo:

* Probably be better to convert this to a rake task.
* learn how to to do code block formatting in textile. (grrr...)
